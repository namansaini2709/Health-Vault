# Test the HealthVault file upload functionality

This project has been updated to fix the file upload issues in the patient portal. Here's what was implemented:

1. Enhanced error handling in the PatientDashboard.tsx
2. Added file validation in the FileUpload.tsx component
3. Added detailed troubleshooting documentation in TROUBLESHOOTING.md
4. Created diagnostic tools to verify Supabase connection

## To Test the Fix:

1. Make sure your .env file has the correct Supabase configuration:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   cd /workspace/shadcn-ui
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to the patient portal

4. Try to upload a file (PDF, JPG, PNG, GIF, or WebP format)
   - The file should be less than 10MB
   - You must select a category for the document

5. You should see feedback during the upload process:
   - Loading messages when upload starts
   - Success message when upload completes
   - Error message if upload fails

## Key Fixes Applied:

- Added proper file size validation (max 10MB)
- Added file type validation (PDF, JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- Improved error messages with specific guidance
- Added loading indicators during the upload process
- Enhanced logging for debugging issues

## Supabase Requirements:

Make sure your Supabase project has:
1. A storage bucket named "medical-records" (see troubleshooting guide for how to create this)
2. A database table named "medical_records" with appropriate columns
3. Proper permissions set for storage and database access
